```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

If we execute following commands (written below), what will be the output?

```{r}
# 
f <- function(x) {
      g <- function(y) {
        y * z
      }
      z <- 4
      x + g(x)
}
y <- 5
z <- 10
f(8)
```

`z <- 10` is unnecessary as `z <- 4` is embedded within the function, and `y <- 5` is unnecessary since `y=x` is implied by `f(g(x))`. 
`f(x)` is isomorphic to the function `h(x) = 5x`:

```{r}
h = function(x){
  return(5*x)
}
h(8)
```

```{r}
test = T
for (i in -10000:10000) {
  if (f(i)!=h(i)) {
    test <- F
  }
}
if (test==F) {
  print("f(x), h(x) different")
} else {
  print("f(x), g(x) identical")
}
```

The output of `f(x)` is `5x`.
