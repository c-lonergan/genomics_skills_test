# genomics_skills_test

A timed skills test I completed while applying for a genomics role. Most questions were attempted using R, and XGBoost was performed using Python.

Topics covered:
- Code efficiency
- Functional programming
- DNA sequence analysis (string manipulation)
- Statistical analysis
- Machine learning (XGBoost)
